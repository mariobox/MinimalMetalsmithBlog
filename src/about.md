blurb: "A minimalistic blog built with Metalsmith."

This is a minimalistic blog built with [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io).

It was made possible thanks to this [awesome tutorial](https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/crafting-a-simple-blog-with-metalsmith/) written by [Parimal Satyal](http://www.neustadt.fr/).

Parimal's tutorial lets you create a barebones Metalsmith blog. I have added a link to [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap) in the <head> to give it some styling, and adapted a basic nav bar at the bottom of the templates to make navigation easier.

I will tweak and add some more improvements to this project as I go along learning.

Here is the source code for this blog. 

Here is a link to the live demo, and to the repository containing the final HTML files (served to the web as a Github project page).

Thanks.
